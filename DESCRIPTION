Description: flowGate adds an interactive Shiny app to allow manual 
    GUI-based gating of flow cytometry data in R. Using flowGate, 
    you can draw 1D and 2D span/rectangle gates, quadrant gates, 
    and polygon gates on flow cytometry data by interactively drawing 
    the gates on a plot of your data, rather than by specifying gate 
    coordinates. This package is especially geared toward wet-lab 
    cytometerists looking to take advantage of R for cytometry 
    analysis, without necessarily having a lot of R experience.
